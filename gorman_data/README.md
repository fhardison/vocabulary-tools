# About the Gorman Tree Lemma Count Data

`lemma_counts.txt` contains the counts for each lemma for each work in Vanessa
Gorman's treebank of Ancient Greek prose.

The first field is the work reference (TLG author:work), the second field the
lemma as given by Gorman, and the third field the count for that lemma within
that work.

`lemma_counts_GD.txt` contains the subset for the intersection between works in
Diorsis and Gorman.
